# Advent of Code

This is a repository of [perl](https://www.perl.org) solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
While often cleaned up after submission, the overall logic has not been changed aside from a few cases where my
original solution was _really_ slow. Years prior to 2020 were not done during the contest timeframe as I did not
find out about AoC until 2020.
