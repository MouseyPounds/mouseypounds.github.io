'*' in front of a fish means they would match based on tags but are excluded for another reason.
All legendary fish are exluded by tag `fish_legendary`, so the final pond type is just a safety net default.
And Clams are excluded because their category is 'Basic -23' instead of 'Fish'.
Production chances are for choosing a product and are rolled after a separate 23-95% chance based on population (.15 + .08*pop)
